# pr-milestone-checker

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that checks that all the pull requests are tagged with a GitHub milestone.

## Usage

When a pull request is created/updated, this application checks whether it is properly [milestoned](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-milestones).
